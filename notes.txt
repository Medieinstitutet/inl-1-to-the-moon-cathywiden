known issues

1. menu won't close
2. menu page justify-content: space-evenly won't apply, the three menu points won't spread along the screen height
3. boxy text: padding/margin impossible to set or control, padding no worky, padding-inline no worky, ...
4. hamburger menu middle line used to move sideways on hover butt by adding the pointer-events: none, this broke
5. hambuerger menu also used to turn poink on hover just because I misread the instructions..., well now that's broken too due to pointer-eents: none in .hamburger
6. there should be an intended hover action over the menu lines which should invoke an underline but no worky
7. overlay menu should disappear - in my mind - once I'm scrolling over the second page (space background)
